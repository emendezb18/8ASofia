<h2>Countries After the War</h2>
    <h3>United states</h3>

    <p>The Vietnam war had many effects and changes to the whole American nation. One of the many effects it had were its social division. Americans divided in two different perspectives of the war in Vietnam. The first one was that the war was a need and that it was necessary while the other people saw it as a fundamentally wrong and immoral act of the United States..</p>

    <p>Other effects war had in the United States was the amount of casualties,(Deaths),that the Vietnamese war gave.About 58,200 fatal casualties and Vietnamwith about 2 million casualties In total.Also the Army was completely demoralized became scared of attacking or trying the same thing on another country because of the fear they had that they'd be another Vietnam.Another effect on the Army was because of the “the public's aversion to casualties inspired strict guidelines for the commitment of forces abroad and a heavy reliance on air power to project American military power”. </p>

    <p>One of the major and biggest effect the United States Of America suffered because of the Vietnamese war was the severe damage onto its economy.Because the citizens were unwilling to pay taxes for the money spent on the war and that caused a massed inflation on the whole Nation.To be exact,the united states inflation was of 14% which was depressing and atrocious to such a global power.</p>

    <h3>Vietnam</h3>

    <p>Vietnam was the most damaged and most affected country out of all.Its mortality was the highest with 2 million deaths in only civilians and 1.8 million deaths in soldiers.This leaved many families ruined,orphans,wives without husband and big poverty to the country.Also the country through all the war received attacks on its cities and infrastructure, almost half of the major cities on  the country were ruined by the united states bombarding and public need such as hospitals police stations and fire departments where mostly destroyed or without the help of the state.</p>

    <p>Another major effect was its economy, while vietnam didn't spend that much money on its army or supplies as the United States it still used a lot and it really affected the whole country.Also, its agriculture was almost completely ruined by the many chemicals the United States spread to the country,(Agent Orange).This was one of the most controversial attack of the United States because it effects were atrocious.”In 1969 alone, 1,034,300 hectares of forest was destroyed using Agent Orange. Agent Blue was sprayed on crops in an effort to deprive the North of its food supply. Between 1962 and 1969, 688,000 acres of agricultural land was sprayed – primarily on paddy fields.</p>
    
    <p>Vietnam was ruined”. Another effect of the chemical was the enormous amount of genetic harm it caused to the new generation of Vietnamese post war by leaving them with extreme physical deformities and premature deaths. 
        Still to the present day Agent Orange still presents many harm to VIetnam in its whole environment and society.

<h2>Countries before The War</h2>

<h3>United States</h3>
<p>United States in the 1950s was considered the “Golden age”, it was called liked these because there were many drastic changes that favored and helps the country get better in every aspect such as socially and economically. In this time the urbanization in the United States started, in 3 years tit had doubled the amount of properties in the whole country! Also, this was the time when Rock N Roll was created and began to get recognized internationally. Also in this decade was when the Civil Rights Movement started to get power and also making progress. This can be proved by the desegregation of schools in the whole country, this meant that black kids could attend their education with the white kids and not have a different section or school because of their ethnicity and race. This really helped the black community and infants because by integrating both races in a single group and community made them feel as equal as everyone else because before that they felt inferior and as having less value as a person. Then one of the most important man of United States history came into place, he was Martin Luther King Junior. He was the one who really manage to make the Civil Rights Movement succeed on the world. His most important and known achievement was the “I Have a Dream”speach, almost 220,000 thousand people attend and other million heard it.

<h3>Vietnam</h3>

<p>Vietnam is one of the countries with biggest history in South East Asia, its amount of wars, empires and culture richness it has is tremendously large and interesting. Before the Vietnam war there happened some conflicts and drastic changes, the one conflict that happened before the main war was the Independence in September 2 of 1945. 

    The man who made all of this possible was Ho Chi Minh. He was the leader of the Resistance Movement, and the main pilar for the Independence. He was the one who politically and socially fighted against the French and the Chinese. Also he was the head of the guerilla who made many of the best strategic attacks in South East Asia history.
    
    After the many attacks from each bando and the 192,000 deaths they made the Geneva Accords. This agreement meant the total withdrawal of every French Forces. The next and last event after the Geneva Accord was the one who provocated the next war, the separation of the state. North Vietnam & South Vietnam.

<h2>Political limits</h2>
<p>Close to the end of 1954 there was introduced a major political division that changed at ended the whole war, this was the separation of both sides of Vietnam, South and North. This division was created because half Vietnamese wanted communism and the other half wanted capitalism. So, what they did to liberate the tension and stop their fighting each one agreed to divide the state and to make it officially a year later.But then South Vietnam received a coup.The reason was because many civilians in the south were in favor of communism, then they formed a group called “Viet Cong” which were mainly civilians who fought in the war or people who were tired of the corruption and unfairness that capitalism gave to them.


    Then in the start of  1960 is when the real war started, North Vietnam started to help Viet Cong by managing and giving resources and supplies to make their army way better. Later onto the war Viet cong had managed to affect in a rapid phase South Vietnam by already taking 20% of its territory, this is when North Vietnam started to enter officially the fight and send better trained and equipped soldiers to combat. This was extremely useful because by that help Viet Cong had managed to take 60% of the country. In this time is when United States starts to get involved. They started to involucrate onto the war because in that period of time they were on the Cold War and fightings against communism so when they saw ta opportunity to attack it they used it.
    
    Now in 1967 South Vietnam started to receive the help and support of the United States and  by that they managed to recover 30% of the land lost before. Then in 1971 and 1972 United States invaded Cambodia to completely destroy the Ho chi Minh routes that were used to support and help Viet Cong. Then, the last years of war came into place. Because both parties were completely destroyed and overwhelmed by everything they decided to make the Paris Peace Agreement which meant the retirement and evacuations of Americans in the war and leaving South Vietnam alone. This decision created the loss of South Vietnam in the war and converted the country into what it is today.
