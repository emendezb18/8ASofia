  <p class="texto1">The Vietnam War, last from 1955 to 1975, emerges as a profoundly impactful and contentious chapter in 20th-century history. Its origins consist in Vietnam's quest for independence, amplified by intensifying ideological tensions during the Cold War, weaving a narrative of complexity and far-reaching consequences. The conflict opposed the communist-led government in the northern part of Vietnam, backed by the Soviet Union and China, against the non-communist government in the southern region, primarily supported by the United States. Beyond forming lasting changes on the geography and historical fabric of Vietnam, the war left a permanent legacy of profound social and political divisions, both within the country and on the global stage.</p>

  <p class="texto">The Vietnam War, also called the Second Indochina War, was a military conflict between 1955 and 1975 to prevent the union of Vietnam under a communist government. The Republic of Vietnam participated in this war with the support of the United States. It is estimated that 3.8 and 5.7 million people died during the conflict. It is an important part of the Cold War. The Vietnam War was a complicated conflict consolidated by historical, ideological and geopolitical factors. Its impact extended beyond the military sphere and shaped the political and social landscape of both countries, the United States and Vietnam. The war remains a powerful and controversial chapter in modern history, ongoing debates about the nature of war, and the search for national interests.
