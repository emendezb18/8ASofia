    <center><p class="texto"> The Phutai people make things hard for researchers because
        they've mixed with other groups making it confusing to tell which is which.
        In Vietnam, they're not officially seen as a different group, but they're part of
        a larger group, the Thai group.
        The name Phutai is common in Thailand, meaning Tai people, which makes them even
        more confusing because they have two names, and also in specific that group because
        of their cultural practices and their traditions
        </center>
    </p>
    <center> <p class="texto">
        
            Geographically, you can find the Phuthai group spread out in Laos, Vietnam and
            Thailand, there's a chance they are also in the Southwest Yunnan Province in China.
            Some Phutai who needed help in the early years, they found refuges in the United States
            and there they formed a small community in Los Angeles, around 1970’s.

        it as a native language, Thai is also known as Siamese, this language is part of Thai
        family, it was the original language but then it was modified and now its just called

    <center><p class="texto1"> 
            The Thai alphabet is completely different as the alphabet we know is based on the Old
            Khmer alphabet which is the oldest language from the family Khmer Language that is from
            Cambodia,South Vietnam, Thailand and Laos. The alphabet from the Thai language was created
            in the early 7th century using a script that originated in South India.

            When Thailand was an agrarian society which means a community whose economy is
            based on producing and maintaining crops and farmland, the rituals that people
            made were according to the Buddhist calendar, there people were giving out food,
            clothing, medicine and shelters, this was called the monks, which were the highest
            form of attaining goodwill or karma in the family.

        <center><p class="texto2"> 
        In Cambodia, most of the people follow Theravada Buddhism that is a religion, they look up to the
        Buddha for their teaching and monastic monnunity (Sangha). These things help Cambodian society,
        Buddhism is an important religion but isnt strong in education and beliefs, thats why they look up
        to the Budddha.
        Buddhism in Cambodia is not seen as gos like christians do, its just seen as a respected religion.

            Some Cambodians become monks to bring good luck to their families, the Busshists temple is really
            important to them and they just visite them during special days and ask for blessings to the monks,
            but if for some reason Budhisms cant go to the temple, they pray at home.

        they also used languages like French and English. After wars, the government grouped people based on language
        and where they live. They have three main groups: Lao Loum (Lowland Lao), Lao Theung (Lao of the Mountain
        Slopes), and Lao Soung (Lao of the Mountain Tops). Each group has its own language and way of life.
